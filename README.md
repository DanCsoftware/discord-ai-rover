# Rover 🤖  
AI assistant concept for Discord communities

## Overview
**Rover** is a conceptual AI assistant designed to live inside Discord communities and reduce friction for both moderators and members.

The project explores how AI can support **contextual help**, not replace human interaction.

## Problem
Discord communities struggle with:
- Repeated questions
- Poor onboarding for new members
- Moderator burnout
- Information scattered across channels

Most bots are command-driven and brittle.

## Solution
Rover acts as:
- A conversational AI embedded directly in community channels
- A contextual assistant that responds based on conversation flow
- A lightweight layer on top of existing community dynamics

The focus is **augmentation, not automation**.

## Key Features

- Designed to reduce repetitive moderator tasks
- Community-first UX approach

## Tech Stack
